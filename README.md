# Overview
This repository contains the code and data for a flight price prediction model. The model is trained on a dataset of historical flight prices and other factors, such as departure and arrival airports, date, time of day, and airline. The model can be used to predict the price of a future flight based on these factors.
Though the predicated price and actual price may differ significantly because of future events and other economical factors.
